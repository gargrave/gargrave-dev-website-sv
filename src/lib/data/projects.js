export const intro = `
A handful of non-work-related projects I have built when I have had some
free time. Time and energy to work on this kind of stuff outside of work
is generally fairly limited, but I do my best to ensure I stay
up-to-date on new technologies and push myself to learn new things and
apply them in a project somewhere. Some of these are pretty old, though,
so tread carefully!

Side note: many of these have demo links, but I really don't have time
to actually maintain them, so don't hold it against me if you run into
any issues.

Also: be sure to [check out my GitHub profile](https://github.com/gargrave?tab=repositories)
for many more various projects and experiments!
