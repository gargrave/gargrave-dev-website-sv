Hello! My name is Gabe, and I am a software engineer. I love building things,
and I love seeing the things I build come to life and help users get their tasks done
better, faster, and more enjoyably.

I enjoy working on teams with a strong sense of growth and continuous improvement, as I believe
everyone always has something to teach, regardless of position or experience level. I am comfortable
both  as an individual contributor and in more tech leadership-focused roles—different teams have different needs,
and I'm happy to fulfill whatever role brings the most value.
