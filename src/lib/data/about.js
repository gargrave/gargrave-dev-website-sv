export const intro = `
Hi there! My name is Gabe Hargrave, and I am a software engineer primarily focused on frontend
web development. I love to be constantly learning and trying out new things, and then sharing
what I've learned with those around me. I love working on teams where everyone is not only
passionate about what we're building, but also about sharing knowledge and brainstorming and
helping each other become better developers. I also love debating at great length what the
best name for a variable would be. This site is more or less a glorified version of my resume,
albeit with some expanded information in a few places.
