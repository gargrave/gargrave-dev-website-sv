export const intro = `
Hello! My name is Gabe, and I am a software engineer. I love building things,
and I love seeing the things I build come to life and help my users get their tasks done
better, faster, and more enjoyably.

I enjoy working on teams with a strong sense of growth and continuous improvement, as I believe
everyone always has something to teach, regardless of position or experience level. I am comfortable
in both individual contributor and tech leadership-focused roles, as I tend to like just doing
whatever I can to bring the most value to the team at any given time (and of course that changes frequently).

I am also perfectly comfortable using either tabs or spaces and have no major preference on the matter, so
I suppose that makes me either a unicorn or a monsterâ€”I'm not quite sure which.

This site is more or less a glorified version of my resume, albeit with some expanded information in a few places.
